# AES256 Encryption (in Objective-C)
This is an implementation of AES-256 for Objective-C, proving encryption/decryption in real-time. Major thanks 
to [Mayur A Birari](https://github.com/mayurbirari/AES256AndBase64) who provided the encryption implementation this
project is based around.

## Purpose
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for offline encryption using Objective-C.

This code is not intended for production use. It uses the app's `bundlePath` as the encryption key which I would not 
recommend using by itself for encryption.

_However_, if this code helps you along your way I'd be honored!
